# Terrazas de Guacuco

### Get Started

- Open Terminal
- Go to your file project (where youâ€™ve unzipped the product)
- (If you are on a linux based terminal) Simply run `npm run install:clean`
- (If not) Run in terminal `npm install`
- (If not) Run in terminal `npm run build:tailwind` (each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in `src/assets/styles/tailwind.css`, you will need to run this command)
- (If not) Run in terminal `npm start`
- Navigate to https://localhost:3000 to locate the build website after npm is up and running.

## Website link 

UTA Cloud link is **https://txg8976.uta.cloud/**.
I've uploaded all the compiled and build files to cPanel of UTA Cloud portal.

## Different Roles for User Login

To see different user profiles, then use these words in the email while logging in through login page.
Use these keywords as subparts of email while logging in and password doesn't matter a lot now since we're not validating.
We will do that in the later phases once we connect our website with PHP and Database.

- Use building_manager for Building Manager Profile.
- Use garden_manager for Garden Manager Profile.
- Use pool_manager for Pool Manager Profile.
- Use security_manager for Security Manager Profile.
- Use resident for resident profile.
- Use visitor for visitor profile.

You can perform CRUD in each of the user profile mentioned as and when required based on usage.
Different profile have different ways of CRUD operations to perform. Rendering pages is made easy with the help of ReactJS.
We've made our website to simply render the react components of user-activity.
